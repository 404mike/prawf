Create an accessible HTML page with two divs. One floated left 80% and another floated right.

Using only JavaScript get the first 10 posts from ```https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts``` and display the post `title` and `body` in the left div.

When a user clicks on a post, fetch all comments for that post from ```https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments?postId={POSTID}``` displaying the persons name and company name from ```https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users?email={EMAIL}```
